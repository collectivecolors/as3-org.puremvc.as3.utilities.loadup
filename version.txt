2.1 Enhancements to asset loader feature
    - new audio asset, based on Sound class, for mp3 files
    - new video asset, for flv/f4v files
    - all asset types now have a flash version and a flex version.
    As a consequence of the flash support, in order to provide swcs that
    exclude flex content, there are now 4 swcs instead of 2. A new ant 
    script build.xml defines the 4 builds. The swcs have been renamed, to
    express the flex/flash distinction. As regards source code changes, 
    the existing asset classes that were flex-specfic have been renamed to
    include "Flex" in the class name.
2.0 This version of the utility is called Loadup instead of StartupManager, 
    to remove the inference that the utility is only relevant at application 
    startup. Class names and some other names have changed accordingly, see
    the separate migration instructions, migrationToV2.txt. Apart from the
    name change, features that are new are set out below.

    The last backward compatible version of the 1.x line is 1.6.1, and 
    it will remain in the StartupManager_1_x branch of the repository 
    in case bug fixes  to the 1.x line are required.
    
    LoadupMonitorProxy (monitor) constructor now takes proxyName as an 
    arg (optional), thus enabling concurrent instances; for an example of
    this, see the LoadupForAssets demo. Property jobId has 
    been dropped - see migration instructions.
    On notifications sent by Loadup, the type is the monitor proxyName.
    On loaded and failed notifications sent by the client app, if 
    the monitor proxyName is not the default name, the notification 
    type MUST BE the monitor proxyName.
    IResourceList methods addResource and addResources have a
    changed signature, to include an arg that references the
    monitor instance. Existing usage that passes an IResourceList as
    the data arg to the monitor constructor must change to (null,data)
    since data is now the second optional arg, proxyName being the
    first. IResourceList has new method isToBeKeptOpen.
    IRetryParameters has a new parameter, to switch on exponential
    backoff logic when RetryPolicy applies the retry interval.

    Existing users of the assetLoader facility, note the following:
    - classes LoadAssetGroupCommand and LoadingInstructions have been
    dropped; it is recommended that users develop their own solution; see 
    the LoadupForAssets demo, version 2, for a sample solution; this is 
    the replacement for the StartupForAssets demo; this demo also has new
    functionality.

    See the LoadupAsOrdered demo, version 2, this is the replacement for 
    the StartupAsOrdered demo.
    
1.6.1 This release is backward compatible.
      Method addResourceViaStartupProxy() of StartupMonitorProxy
      now registers the new StartupResourceProxy objects.
      For background, see 
      http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=259.msg4604#msg4604
1.6 This release is backward compatible.
    Within asset loader feature, in AssetFactory class: support for
    .css urls as asset type Text, plus defaulting to type Text,
    hence reduced likelihood of 'unexpected url type' as an Error 
    condition.
    Within StartupMonitorProxy class: new cleanup method, to remove
    StartupResourceProxy objects from proxy map; also, the reset
    method now includes this cleanup of SRP objects. 
1.5 This release is backward compatible.
    Asset Loader feature; see API docs and StartupForAssets demo.
    New class StartupManager has public consts, as an alternative to
    StartupMonitorProxy.
1.4 In general, increased exposure of state and behaviour, to facilitate
    easier public access and easier adaptation by inheritance. In 
    particular, a new jobId property - see below.
    New features as follows. In StartupMonitorProxy: public access to 
    sendProgressNotification() and allResourcesLoaded(); 
    new addResourceViaStartupProxy() method; 
    new getResourceViaStartupProxyName() method;
    allow override of notification name for 'waiting for more resources';
    new jobId property, included as type on all sent notifications.
    In ResourceList: some vars changed from private to protected access; 
    now responsible for progress percentage calculation;
    new getResourceViaStartupProxyName() method.
    In RetryPolicy: increased exposure of state vars; interface IRetryPolicy
    has additional behaviour, to match that of RetryPolicy.
    In RetryParameters: some vars changed from private to protected access.
    This release is backward compatible.
1.3 - New features: reset() method on StartupMonitorProxy; support for 
      retry policy with automatic retries etc.; support for open-ended 
      resource list. There are interfaces for retry policy and for 
      resource list.
      This release breaks backward compatibility with the previous release.
      Migration is as follows, using the word monitor for the instance of 
      StartupMonitorProxy
      - replace monitor.defaultTimeout = nn, by 
      monitor.defaultRetryPolicy = new RetryPolicy(new RetryParameters(0,0,nn))
      - RetryPolicy and RetryParameters are in the model package
      - review the API documentation to decide what to pass to 
      RetryParameters
      - replace monitor.retryLoadResources() by 
      monitor.tryToCompleteLoadResources()
      - remove LOAD_RESOURCES_REJECTED from notification interests and 
      handling
      - additional notifications are: RETRYING_LOAD_RESOURCE and 
      WAITING_FOR_MORE_RESOURCES.
      See the latest version of StartupAsOrdered demo for example of use.

1.2 - Refactored source into src folder - CLH
1.1 - Cater for timeout.  Provide better overall functionality.
1.0 - Initial release. Works with  PureMVC 2.0 Extracted from the 
      StartupAsOrdered demo.
